# FamilyProjectTracker
Managing the infinite Home Projects and Tasks assaulting the family daily.

The current scope of this project is primarily create a DB for tracking family projects. 
Create an HTML UI using HTML JQUERY Bootstrap etc.
Create an android app as another UI.
 

This project will be a combination of applying what I've been learning to a productive real life problem, and trying to figure out practical issues like: 
What a proper readme should look like, 
and how to use versioning tools like github, 
and what proper commented code should look like across varying technologies,
and how to host a db on NAS where I can access it via cell phone but not have it open to the world, 
and how to publish an app so I don't feel like a hack just downloading my apk with developer mode turned on.

If you stumble accross this readme before I figure out how to do a proper readme this gets deleted, and you feel like giving helpful pointers, have at it.
